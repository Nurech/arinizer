    Maldistribution of doctors in developing countries [7], with awesome populations and the
    increasing demand for healthcare services, new innovative solutions are needed to meet
    the demand [42]. One innovative solution to the problem could be TPR, which is a type of
    CPS that allows a user to interact with a remote environment through a robot [42]. The
    idea of using TPR in HC is not new, as Puma 560 robot performed neurosurgical biopsy in
    1985 [24], but most mentions of telerobotic-surgery and telementoring date back to early
    2000’s [3]. At time wired internet connectivity speeds (300-600 kbp) were sufficient to
    support such systems, in practice however broadband connections were limiting factor
    to deployment of such systems in rural areas [10].
